1>> Design patterns are already defined and provide an industry-standard approach to solving a recurring problem,
 so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern.
2>> Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. 
It helps in reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
33>> Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. 
It leads to faster development and new members of the team understand it easily.
